The general premise behind the Machine Learning k-estimation method as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ml-est} is to divide the Density Observation Section into ten segments to be used as input for the machine learning model. We decided to divide the Density Observation Section into segments so that the machine learning model would be able to account for the distribution of the gas stations along the highway. The 11th and last input into the model is the total distance the vehicle can drive, or the length of the route. To improve accuracy of the model, we standardized the inputs that we trained on. For this reason, the average and standard deviation of the test data must be included as a part of the given model. The inputs are then adjusted by the same average and standard deviation as the training data to produce the estimation for $k$.

The weights in the model, $A$ and $b$, were found by training the model using TensorFlow. The general procedure when training the model is to set these weights to random initial values then slowly modifying them to improve the accuracy of the predictions. When training the model used in our simulations, we used Elastic Net Regression and the loss function described by McClure \cite{McClure}
